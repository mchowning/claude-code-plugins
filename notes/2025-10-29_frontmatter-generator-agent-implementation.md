# Frontmatter-Generator Agent Implementation

## Summary

Replaced the external shell script for frontmatter metadata collection with a specialized workflow-tools agent that executes git and date commands directly using the Bash tool, eliminating script dependencies and enabling permission-free operation.

## Overview

The workflow-tools plugin had three slash commands (`/research-codebase`, `/create-plan`, `/summarize-work`) that needed to collect metadata (date/time, git commit, branch, repository) for documentation frontmatter. Previously, this was done via an external bash script at `workflow-tools/scripts/claude-md-frontmatter.sh`, which required path dependencies and could trigger permission prompts.

This implementation replaces the script with a proper subagent (`frontmatter-generator`) that follows the established workflow-tools agent pattern. The agent executes commands directly via the Bash tool, making it self-contained and eliminating all external dependencies. All three slash commands were updated to invoke the agent using the Task tool instead of executing the script, and the script file was deleted.

## Technical Details

### Creating the Frontmatter-Generator Agent

The core change was creating a new agent definition that encapsulates all metadata collection logic. This agent follows the same structure as other workflow-tools agents (like `codebase-locator` and `codebase-analyzer`):

```markdown
---
name: frontmatter-generator
description: Internal workflow agent for explicit invocation only. Executes git and date commands to collect metadata (date/time, git commit, branch, repository) for workflow-tools documentation templates.
tools: Bash
---

You are a metadata collection agent for workflow-tools documentation generation. Your sole purpose is to gather system and git metadata when explicitly invoked by workflow commands.
```

The agent's restricted toolset (`tools: Bash`) ensures it only has access to command execution, preventing any file modifications and avoiding permission prompts. The description explicitly states "for explicit invocation only" to prevent auto-discovery when users ask general questions.

The agent executes four specific commands:

1. **Date/Time with Timezone**: `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z'`
2. **Git Commit Hash**: `git rev-parse HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "Not in git repository"`
3. **Current Branch**: `git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "No branch"`
4. **Repository Name**: `basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || echo "No repository"`

Each command includes error handling to gracefully handle non-git directories or other edge cases. The agent returns results in a structured format that calling commands can easily parse.

**Key Design Decision**: By executing commands directly in the agent rather than calling an external script, we eliminate the dependency on `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` environment variable and make the agent work regardless of where the plugin is installed.

### Updating Slash Command Invocations

All three slash commands needed to switch from script execution to agent invocation. The pattern was consistent across all updates:

**Old approach** (example from `research-codebase.md:70`):
```markdown
Run the the script `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/claude-md-frontmatter.sh` to generate the frontmatter.
```

**New approach**:
```markdown
Invoke the frontmatter-generator agent using Task tool with `subagent_type: workflow-tools:frontmatter-generator` to collect metadata.
Wait for the agent to return metadata before proceeding.
```

This change was applied to:
- `workflow-tools/commands/research-codebase.md:69-70` - Also fixed incorrect date command syntax from `` date `%Y-%m-%d` `` to `date '+%Y-%m-%d'`
- `workflow-tools/commands/create-plan.md:167`
- `workflow-tools/commands/summarize-work.md:125` and `workflow-tools/commands/summarize-work.md:282` (success criteria checklist)

**Why Task Tool Invocation**: Using the Task tool with explicit `subagent_type` provides clear, consistent invocation across all workflow commands. The instruction to "wait for the agent to return metadata before proceeding" ensures proper sequencing in command execution.

### Additional Improvements

While updating `implement-plan.md`, several formatting improvements were made to enhance readability:

- Added blank lines after markdown list items (lines 8, 15, 24, 34, 49, 60, 70, 81)
- Improved code block formatting for the "Issue in Phase [N]" example
- Enhanced visual separation between sections

These changes don't affect functionality but make the command documentation more readable and consistent with markdown best practices.

**Why These Changes**: The formatting improvements were made opportunistically since the file was already being edited. They follow the principle of leaving code (and documentation) better than you found it, without creating unnecessary diff noise by reformatting unrelated files.

### Removing the Shell Script

The final change removed the now-obsolete shell script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# Collect metadata
DATETIME_TZ=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z')

if command -v git >/dev/null 2>&1 && git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
  REPO_NAME=$(basename "$REPO_ROOT")
  GIT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
  GIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
else
  REPO_NAME=""
  GIT_BRANCH=""
  GIT_COMMIT=""
fi

echo "Current Date/Time (TZ): $DATETIME_TZ"
[ -n "$GIT_COMMIT" ] && echo "Current Git Commit Hash: $GIT_COMMIT"
[ -n "$GIT_BRANCH" ] && echo "Current Branch Name: $GIT_BRANCH"
[ -n "$REPO_NAME" ] && echo "Repository Name: $REPO_NAME"
```

This 22-line script was completely replaced by the agent definition. The agent performs the exact same operations but in a more maintainable, self-documented, and permission-free way.

**Note**: The `scripts/` directory itself was not removed because it may contain other scripts or be referenced elsewhere in the codebase.
