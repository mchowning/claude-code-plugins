Use both local `git` commands to search the local git history and use the `gh` cli to search the history on GitHub as appropriate. Pull request (PR) descriptions and PR comments may contain additional helpful information, so make sure to search those as well.

Your response should include:

- Relevant commits, with the commit hash, the date of the commit, the commit description, and a summary of the commit's changes along with analysis of why those changes are relevant.
- Relevant PRs, with the PR number, the PR description, any relevant PR comments, a summary of the PR's changes that highlights any relevant changes, any Jira tickets referenced in the PR name, branch, or description, and an analysis of why this PR is relevant.

IMPORTANT: Use full code snippets in your response of relevant changes.

Consider how applicable the information that you find is to the current state of the codebase. Include that analysis in your response.
